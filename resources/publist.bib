	abstract = {The study of viral communities has revealed the enormous diversity and impact these biological entities have on various ecosystems. These observations have sparked widespread interest in developing computational strategies that support the comprehensive characterisation of viral communities based on sequencing data. Here we introduce VIRify, a new computational pipeline designed to provide a user-friendly and accurate functional and taxonomic characterisation of viral communities. VIRify identifies viral contigs and prophages from metagenomic assemblies and annotates them using a collection of viral profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). These include our manually-curated profile HMMs, which serve as specific taxonomic markers for a wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic viral taxa and are thus used to reliably classify viral contigs. We tested VIRify on assemblies from two microbial mock communities, a large metagenomics study, and a collection of publicly available viral genomic sequences from the human gut. The results showed that VIRify could identify sequences from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, and provided taxonomic classifications from the genus to the family rank with an average accuracy of 86.6\%. In addition, VIRify allowed the detection and taxonomic classification of a range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses present in 243 marine metagenomic assemblies. Finally, the use of VIRify led to a large expansion in the number of taxonomically classified human gut viral sequences and the improvement of outdated and shallow taxonomic classifications. Overall, we demonstrate that VIRify is a novel and powerful resource that offers an enhanced capability to detect a broad range of viral contigs and taxonomically classify them.},

	abstract = {Strains of Xanthomonas citri pv. malvacearum cause bacterial blight of cotton, a potentially serious threat to cotton production worldwide, including in sub-Saharan countries. Development of disease symptoms, such as water soaking, has been linked to the activity of a class of type 3 effectors, called transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors, which induce susceptibility genes in the host's cells. To gain further insight into the global diversity of the pathogen, to elucidate their repertoires of TAL effector genes, and to better understand the evolution of these genes in the cotton-pathogenic xanthomonads, we sequenced the genomes of three African strains of X. citri pv. malvacearum using nanopore technology. We show that the cotton-pathogenic pathovar of X. citri is a monophyletic lineage containing at least three distinct genetic subclades, which appear to be mirrored by their repertoires of TAL effectors. We observed an atypical level of TAL effector gene pseudogenization, which might be related to resistance genes that are deployed to control the disease. Our work thus contributes to a better understanding of the conservation and importance of TAL effectors in the interaction with the host plant, which can inform strategies for improving resistance against bacterial blight in cotton.},

	abstract = {Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a bacterial pathogen that becomes lethal to Penaeus shrimps when acquiring the pVA1-type plasmid carrying the PirABvp genes, causing acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND). This disease causes significant losses across the world, with outbreaks reported in Southeast Asia, Mexico, and South America. Virulence level and mortality differences have been reported in isolates from different locations, and whether this phenomenon is caused by plasmid-related elements or genomic-related elements from the bacteria remains unclear. Here, nine genomes of South American AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus (VPAHPND) isolates were assembled and analyzed using a comparative genomics approach at (i) whole-genome, (ii) secretion system, and (iii) plasmid level, and then included for a phylogenomic analysis with another 86 strains. Two main results were obtained from our analyses. First, all isolates contained pVA1-type plasmids harboring the toxin coding genes, and with high similarity with the prototypical sequence of Mexican-like origin, while phylogenomic analysis showed some level of heterogeneity with discrete clusters and wide diversity compared to other available genomes. Second, although a high genomic similarity was observed, variation in virulence genes and clusters was observed, which might be relevant in the expression of the disease. Overall, our results suggest that South American pathogenic isolates are derived from various genetic lineages which appear to have acquired the plasmid through horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, pathogenicity seems to be a multifactorial trait where the degree of virulence could be altered by the presence or variations of several virulence factors.
IMPORTANCE AHPND have caused losses of over \$2.6 billion to the aquaculture industry around the world due to its high mortality rate in shrimp farming. The most common etiological agent is V. parahaemolyticus strains possessing the pVA1-type plasmid carrying the PirABvp toxin. Nevertheless, complete understanding of the role of genetic elements and their impact in the virulence of this pathogen remains unclear. In this work, we analyzed nine South American AHPND-causing V. parahaemolyticus isolates at a genomic level, and assessed their evolutionary relationship with other 86 strains. We found that all our isolates were highly similar and possessed the Mexican-type plasmid, but their genomic content did not cluster with other Mexican strains, but instead were spread across all isolates. These results suggest that South American VPAHPND have different genetic backgrounds, and probably proceed from diverse geographical locations, and acquire the pVA1-type plasmid via horizontal gene transfer at different times.},

Here, we report the development of protocols for the rational design of profile HMMs. These methods were implemented on TABAJARA, a program that can be used to either detect all biological sequences of a group or discriminate specific groups of sequences. By calculating position-specific information scores along a multiple sequence alignment, TABAJARA automatically identifies the most informative sequence motifs and uses them to construct profile HMMs. As a proof-of-principle, we applied TABAJARA to generate profile HMMs for the detection and classification of two viral groups presenting different evolutionary rates: bacteriophages of the Microviridae family and viruses of the Flavivirus genus. We obtained conserved models for the generic detection of any Microviridae or Flavivirus sequence, and profile HMMs that can specifically discriminate Microviridae subfamilies or Flavivirus species. In another application, we constructed Cas1 endonuclease-derived profile HMMs that can discriminate CRISPRs and casposons, two evolutionarily related transposable elements. We believe that the protocols described here, and implemented on TABAJARA, constitute a generic toolbox for generating profile HMMs for the highly sensitive and specific detection of sequence classes.},

	abstract = {A universal taxonomy of viruses is essential for a comprehensive view of the virus world and for communicating the complicated evolutionary relationships among viruses. However, there are major differences in the conceptualisation and approaches to virus classification and nomenclature among virologists, clinicians, agronomists, and other interested parties. Here, we provide recommendations to guide the construction of a coherent and comprehensive virus taxonomy, based on expert scientific consensus. Firstly, assignments of viruses should be congruent with the best attainable reconstruction of their evolutionary histories, i.e., taxa should be monophyletic. This fundamental principle for classification of viruses is currently included in the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) code only for the rank of species. Secondly, phenotypic and ecological properties of viruses may inform, but not override, evolutionary relatedness in the placement of ranks. Thirdly, alternative classifications that consider phenotypic attributes, such as being vector-borne (e.g., “arboviruses”), infecting a certain type of host (e.g., “mycoviruses,” “bacteriophages”) or displaying specific pathogenicity (e.g., “human immunodeficiency viruses”), may serve important clinical and regulatory purposes but often create polyphyletic categories that do not reflect evolutionary relationships. Nevertheless, such classifications ought to be maintained if they serve the needs of specific communities or play a practical clinical or regulatory role. However, they should not be considered or called taxonomies. Finally, while an evolution-based framework enables viruses discovered by metagenomics to be incorporated into the ICTV taxonomy, there are essential requirements for quality control of the sequence data used for these assignments. Combined, these four principles will enable future development and expansion of virus taxonomy as the true evolutionary diversity of viruses becomes apparent.},

Our results reveal that prophages were present in 75\% of the genomes studied. In addition, Enterobacterales were significantly enriched in prophages. We also found that pathogens are a significant reservoir of prophages. Finally, we determined that the prophage relatedness and the range of genomic hosts were delimited by the evolutionary relationships of their hosts. On a broader level, we got insights into the prophage population, identified in thousands of publicly available prokaryotic genomes, by comparing the prophage distribution and relatedness between them and their hosts.

	abstract = {SUMMARY
Over a century of bacteriophage research has uncovered a plethora of fundamental aspects of their biology, ecology, and evolution. Furthermore, the introduction of community-level studies through metagenomics has revealed unprecedented insights on the impact that phages have on a range of ecological and physiological processes. It was not until the introduction of viral metagenomics that we began to grasp the astonishing breadth of genetic diversity encompassed by phage genomes. Novel phage genomes have been reported from a diverse range of biomes at an increasing rate, which has prompted the development of computational tools that support the multilevel characterization of these novel phages based solely on their genome sequences. The impact of these technologies has been so large that, together with MAGs (Metagenomic Assembled Genomes), we now have UViGs (Uncultivated Viral Genomes), which are now officially recognized by the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), and new taxonomic groups can now be created based exclusively on genomic sequence information. Even though the available tools have immensely contributed to our knowledge of phage diversity and ecology, the ongoing surge in software programs makes it challenging to keep up with them and the purpose each one is designed for. Therefore, in this review, we describe a comprehensive set of currently available computational tools designed for the characterization of phage genome sequences, focusing on five specific analyses: (i) assembly and identification of phage and prophage sequences, (ii) phage genome annotation, (iii) phage taxonomic classification, (iv) phage-host interaction analysis, and (v) phage microdiversity.},

	abstract = {The microbiota in broiler chicken intestines affects the animals’ health, metabolism, and immunity both positively and negatively. Accordingly, it has a significant impact on animal productivity. Phages, host-specific parasites of bacterial cells, are a promising antimicrobial alternative that selectively target pathogens without disturbing the microbiota. The purpose of this study is to further characterize the commensal microbial community at production scale in broiler chickens treated with a Salmonella phage treatment. We evaluated the cecal microbiota of broilers reared in a commercial farming system where a phage cocktail against Salmonella, SalmoFree was supplied to animals. To do so, two field trials were conducted, incorporating three doses of phages in the broilers’ drinking water. Our results showed that the core microbiome (taxa that were present in more than 50\% of samples) contained species that are key to microbiota adaptation in the last stage of the production cycle. Among these, there are some important degraders of complex polysaccharides and producers of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) such as Eisenbergiella and Lachnoclostridium. The phage cocktail did not affect the normal development of the microbiota’s structure. The addition of the phage cocktail resulted in a significant reduction in Campylobacter and an increase in Butyricimonas, Helicobacter and Rikenellaceae, which are common inhabitants in chicken gut with known negative and positive effects on their health and metabolism. Altogether, we consider that these results contribute valuable information to the implementation of large-scale phage therapy technologies.},

	abstract = {Replacement of high-value fish species with cheaper varieties or mislabelling of food unfit for human consumption is a global problem violating both consumers’ rights and safety. For distinguishing fish species in pure samples, DNA approaches are available; however, authentication and quantification of fish species in mixtures remains a challenge. In the present study, a novel high-throughput shotgun DNA sequencing approach applying masked reference libraries was developed and used for authentication and abundance calculations of fish species in mixed samples. Results demonstrate that the analytical protocol presented here can discriminate and predict relative abundances of different fish species in mixed samples with high accuracy. In addition to DNA analyses, shotgun proteomics tools based on direct spectra comparisons were employed on the same mixture. Similar to the DNA approach, the identification of individual fish species and the estimation of their respective relative abundances in a mixed sample also were feasible. Furthermore, the data obtained indicated that DNA sequencing using masked libraries predicted species-composition of the fish mixture with higher specificity, while at a taxonomic family level, relative abundances of the different species in the fish mixture were predicted with slightly higher accuracy using proteomics tools. Taken together, the results demonstrate that both DNA and protein-based approaches presented here can be used to efficiently tackle current challenges in feed and food authentication analyses.},

Here, we present PhageClouds, a novel approach using a graph database of phage genomic sequences and their intergenomic distances to explore the phage genomic sequence space.

Methods: A total of 640,000 phage genomic sequences were retrieved from a variety of databases and public virome assemblies. Intergenomic distances were calculated with dashing, an alignment-free method suitable for handling massive data sets. These data were used to build a Neo4j® graph database.

Results: PhageClouds supported the search of related phages among all complete phage genomes from GenBank for a single query phage in just 10 s. Moreover, PhageClouds expanded the number of closely related phage sequences detected for both finished and draft phage genomes, in comparison with searches exclusively targeting phage entries from GenBank.

Conclusions: PhageClouds is a novel resource that will facilitate the analysis of phage genomic sequences and the characterization of assembled phage genomes.},

Inclusion of uncultivated viruses has already improved the process as well as the understanding of the taxa, viruses, and their evolutionary relationships.

In spite of their broad abundance, viruses, in particular bacteriophages, remain largely unknown since only about 20\% of sequences obtained from viral community DNA surveys could be annotated by comparison with public databases. In order to shed some light into this genetic dark matter we expanded the search of orthologous groups as potential markers to viral taxonomy from bacteriophages and included eukaryotic viruses, establishing a set of 31,150 ViPhOGs (Eukaryotic Viruses and Phages Orthologous Groups). To do this, we examine the non-redundant viral diversity stored in public databases, predict proteins in genomes lacking such information, and used all annotated and predicted proteins to identify potential protein domains. The clustering of domains and unannotated regions into orthologous groups was done using cogSoft. Finally, we employed a random forest implementation to classify genomes into their taxonomy and found that the presence or absence of ViPhOGs is significantly associated with their taxonomy. Furthermore, we established a set of 1457 ViPhOGs that given their importance for the classification could be considered as markers or signatures for the different taxonomic groups defined by the ICTV at the order, family, and genus levels.},

	abstract = {Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 (CDK2) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor (VEGFR2) have largely been considered as attractive targets for developing anticancer agents. However, there is no dual inhibitor commercially available in the market that interacts simultaneously with the allosteric back pocket of these enzymes. We applied a combined computational strategy that started with the generation of two overlapping pharmacophore models of both kinases at ‘inactive’ conformation. Next, several virtual libraries of natural products, including the databases TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine), UEFS (Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana), NuBBE (Nuclei of Bioassays, Biosynthesis, and Ecophysiology of Natural Products) and AfroDb (African Medicinal Plants Database) were deconstructed using a non-extensive version of the approach RECAP (retrosynthetic combinatorial analysis procedure). These natural-product-derived fragments (NPDFs) were screened and merged into drug-sized compounds, which were filtered by Lipinski’s Rule-of-five (Ro5) and docking. As a result, two pharmacophore models, namely Hypo1 and Hypo2, were developed with an accuracy of 0.94 and 0.84, respectively. Deconstruction of natural products produced a set of 16655 unique non-extensive NPDFs that were screened against both pharmacophore models. Finally, after merging, Ro5-filtering and docking, we obtained a set of 20 hit compounds predicted to be diverse, developable, synthesizable and potent. The computational strategy proved successful to find virtual candidates of kinase inhibitors and therefore contributes to the identification of innovative multi-target compounds with potential anticancer activity.

	abstract = {Bacteriophages are considered the most abundant biological entities on earth, and they are able to modulate the populations of their bacterial hosts. Although the potential of bacteriophages has been accepted as an alternative strategy to combat multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria, there still exists a considerable knowledge gap regarding their genetic diversity, which hinders their use as antimicrobial agents. In this study, we undertook a genomic and phylogenetic characterization of the phage Ab11510-phi, which was isolated from a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain (Ab11510). We found that Ab11510-phi has a narrow host range and belongs to a small group of transposable phages of the genus Vieuvirus that have only been reported to infect Acinetobacter bacteria. Finally, we showed that Ab11510-phi (as well as other vieuvirus phages) has a high level of mosaicism. On a broader level, we demonstrate that comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis are necessary tools for the proper characterization of phage diversity.},

Differences in the microbiota composition of wild and captive animals has been evaluated; however, variation during a reintroduction process in primates has never been reported. Our aim was to identify changes in the bacterial composition of three individuals of reintroduced woolly monkeys (Lagothrix lagothricha) and the variables associated with such changes. Fecal samples were collected and the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced to determine gut microbial composition and functionality. Individual samples from released individuals showed a higher microbial diversity after being released compared to before liberation, associated with changes in their diet. Beta diversity and functionality analysis showed separation of samples from released and captive conditions and the major factor of variation was the moment of liberation. This study shows that intestinal microbiota varies depending on site conditions and is mainly associated with diet diversity. The intake of food from wild origin by released primates may promote a positive effect on gut microbiota, improving health, and potentially increasing success in reintroduction processes.},

Materials and Methods: A phage was isolated from a soil sample, using Mycobacterium smegmatis as host. Its characterization included sequencing, annotation, and analysis of the genome, host range determination, and electron microscopy imaging.

Results:Mycobacterium phage vB\_MsmS\_Celfi is a temperate phage able to infect Mycobacterium tuberculosis with high efficiency. From electron microscopy images, Celfi belongs to the Siphoviridae family. Genome analysis classified phage Celfi into cluster L, subcluster L2 of Actinobacteriophage clusters. Mycobacterium phage Celfi exhibits a Lysin B distant to those present in other members of the subcluster and other mycobacteriophages.

Conclusions: The discovery of new phages that infect M. tuberculosis could contribute to the development of novel tools for detection systems and future treatment of the disease.},

	abstract = {Poultry production is an industry that generates 90,000 metric tons of chicken meat worldwide. Thus, optimizing chicken growth and sustainable production is of great importance. A central factor determining not only production parameters, but also stability of the immune system and chicken health, is the diversity and variability of the microbiota present throughout the gastrointestinal tract. To date, several studies have investigated the relationship between bacterial communities and the gut microbiome, with limited data to compare. This study aims to create a bacterial meta-analysis based on studies using amplicon sequencing with Illumina sequencing technologies in order to build a baseline for comparison in future analyses of the cecal bacterial composition in chicken. A systematic literature review was performed (SYRF ID: e84f0468-e418-4eec-9da4-b517f1b4809d. Full project URL: https://app.syrf.org.uk/projects/e84f0468-e418-4eec-9da4-b517f1b4809d/detail). From all the available and analyzed manuscripts only nine contained full raw-sequence data available and the corresponding metadata. A total of 324 samples, comprising three different regions within the 16S rRNA gene, were analyzed. Due to the heterogeneity of the data, each region was analyzed independently and an effort for a joint analysis was performed as well. Taxonomic profiling revealed 11 phyla, with Firmicutes as the most prevalent phylum, followed by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. At genus level, 109 genera were found. Shannon metric for alpha diversity showed that factors like type of chickens (Commercial or experimental) and 16S rRNA gene subregion have negligible effect on diversity. Despite the large number of parameters that were taken into account, the identification of common bacteria showed five genera to be common for all sets in at least 50\% of the samples. These genera are highly associated to cellulose degradation and short chain fatty acids synthesis. In general, it was possible to identify some commonalities in the bacterial cecal microbial community despite the extensive variability and factors differing from one study to another.},

We analyzed dietary intake and gut microbiota in a community-dwelling cohort of 441 Colombians. Diet quality, intake of food groups and nutrient consumption were paired with microbial diversity and composition using linear regressions, Procrustes analyses and a random-forest machine-learning algorithm. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders, including the five cities from where the participants originated, sex (male, female), age group (18–40 and 41–62 years), BMI (lean, overweight, obese) and socioeconomic status. Microbial diversity was higher in individuals with increased intake of nutrients obtained from plant-food sources, whereas the intake of food groups and nutrients correlated with microbiota structure. Random-forest regressions identified microbial communities associated with different diet components. Two remarkable results confirmed previous expectations regarding the link between diet and microbiota: communities composed of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers were more prevalent in the microbiota of individuals consuming diets rich in fiber and plant-food sources, such as fruits, vegetables and beans. In contrast, an inflammatory microbiota composed of bile-tolerant and putrefactive microorganisms along with opportunistic pathogens thrived in individuals consuming diets enriched in animal-food sources and of low quality, i.e., enriched in ultraprocessed foods and depleted in dietary fiber. This study expands our understanding of the relationship between dietary intake and gut microbiota. We provide evidence that diet is strongly associated with the gut microbial community and highlight generalizable connections between them.},

The Special Issue on “Diversity and Evolution of Phage Genomes” is a great example with its 17 manuscripts published. It covers some of the latest methods to sample and characterize environmental and host associated viromes, considering experimental biases and computational developments. Furthermore, the use of molecular tools coupled with traditional methods has allowed to isolate and characterize viruses from different hosts and environments with such diversity that even a new viral class is being proposed. The viruses described cover all different phage families and lifestyles. However, is not only about diversity; the molecular evolution is studied in a set of manuscripts looking at phage-host interactions and their capacity to uncover the frequency and type of mutations behind the bacterial resistance mechanisms and viral pathogenesis, and such methods are opening new ways into identifying potential receptors and characterizing the bacterial host range.},

This broad characterization does not allow for precise estimates of prevalence. The LARS score was designed as a simple tool for clinical evaluation of LARS. Although the LARS score has good clinical utility, it may not capture all important aspects that patients may experience. The aim of this collaboration was to develop an international consensus definition of LARS that encompasses all aspects of the condition and is informed by all stakeholders. Method This international patient–provider initiative used an online Delphi survey, regional patient consultation meetings, and an international consensus meeting. Three expert groups participated: patients, surgeons and other health professionals from five regions (Australasia, Denmark, Spain, Great Britain and Ireland, and North America) and in three languages (English, Spanish, and Danish). The primary outcome measured was the priorities for the definition of LARS. Results Three hundred twenty-five participants (156 patients) registered. The response rates for successive rounds of the Delphi survey were 86\%, 96\% and 99\%. Eighteen priorities emerged from the Delphi survey. Patient consultation and consensus meetings refined these priorities to eight symptoms and eight consequences that capture essential aspects of the syndrome. Sampling bias may have been present, in particular, in the patient panel because social media was used extensively in recruitment. There was also dominance of the surgical panel at the final consensus meeting despite attempts to mitigate this. Conclusion This is the first definition of LARS developed with direct input from a large international patient panel. The involvement of patients in all phases has ensured that the definition presented encompasses the vital aspects of the patient experience of LARS. The novel separation of symptoms and consequences may enable greater sensitivity to detect changes in LARS over time and with intervention.},

	abstract = {Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is widely known as deleterious for many organisms since it can cause damage to biomolecules either directly or indirectly via the formation of reactive oxygen species. The goal of this study was to analyze the capacity of high-mountain Espeletia hartwegiana plant phyllosphere microorganisms to survive UVR and to identify genes related to resistance strategies. A strain of Deinococcus swuensis showed a high survival rate of up to 60\% after UVR treatment at 800J/m2 and was used for differential expression analysis using RNA-seq after exposing cells to 400J/m2 of UVR (with {\textgreater}95\% survival rate). Differentially expressed genes were identified using the R-Bioconductor package NOISeq and compared with other reported resistance strategies reported for this genus. Genes identified as being overexpressed included transcriptional regulators and genes involved in protection against damage by UVR. Non-coding (nc)RNAs were also differentially expressed, some of which have not been previously implicated. This study characterized the immediate radiation response of D. swuensis and indicates the involvement of ncRNAs in the adaptation to extreme environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {Microbiomes are vast communities of microorganisms and viruses that populate all natural ecosystems. Viruses have been considered to be the most variable component of microbiomes, as supported by virome surveys and examples of high genomic mosaicism. However, recent evidence suggests that the human gut virome is remarkably stable compared with that of other environments. Here, we investigate the origin, evolution and epidemiology of crAssphage, a widespread human gut virus. Through a global collaboration, we obtained DNA sequences of crAssphage from more than one-third of the world’s countries and showed that the phylogeography of crAssphage is locally clustered within countries, cities and individuals. We also found fully colinear crAssphage-like genomes in both Old-World and New-World primates, suggesting that the association of crAssphage with primates may be millions of years old. Finally, by exploiting a large cohort of more than 1,000 individuals, we tested whether crAssphage is associated with bacterial taxonomic groups of the gut microbiome, diverse human health parameters and a wide range of dietary factors. We identified strong correlations with different clades of bacteria that are related to Bacteroidetes and weak associations with several diet categories, but no significant association with health or disease. We conclude that crAssphage is a benign cosmopolitan virus that may have coevolved with the human lineage and is an integral part of the normal human gut virome.},

	abstract = {The increase in antibiotic resistant bacteria has raised global concern regarding the future effectiveness of antibiotics. Human activities that influence microbial communities and environmental resistomes can generate additional risks to human health. In this work, we characterized aquatic microbial communities and their resistomes in samples collected at three sites along the Bogotá River and from wastewaters at three city hospitals, and investigated community profiles and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) as a function of anthropogenic contamination. The presence of antibiotics and other commonly used drugs increased in locations highly impacted by human activities, while the diverse microbial communities varied among sites and sampling times, separating upstream river samples from more contaminated hospital and river samples. Clinically relevant antibiotic resistant pathogens and ARGs were more abundant in contaminated water samples. Tracking of resistant determinants to upstream river waters and city sources suggested that human activities foster the spread of ARGs, some of which were co-localized with mobile genetic elements in assembled metagenomic contigs. Human contamination of this water ecosystem changed both community structure and environmental resistomes that can pose a risk to human health.},

	abstract = {The order Herpesvirales encompasses a wide variety of important and broadly distributed human pathogens. During the last decades, similarities in the viral cycle and the structure of some of their proteins with those of the order Caudovirales, the tailed bacterial viruses, have brought speculation regarding the existence of an evolutionary relationship between these clades. To evaluate such hypothesis, we used over 600 Herpesvirales and 2000 Caudovirales complete genomes to search for the presence or absence of clusters of orthologous protein domains and constructed a dendrogram based on their compositional similarities. The results obtained strongly suggest an evolutionary relationship between the two orders. Furthermore, they allowed to propose a core genome for the Herpesvirales, composed of 4 proteins, including the ATPase subunit of the DNA-packaging terminase, the only protein with previously verified conservation. Accordingly, a phylogenetic tree constructed with sequences derived from the clusters associated to these proteins grouped the Herpesvirales strains accordingly to the established families and subfamilies. Overall, this work provides results supporting the hypothesis that the two orders are evolutionarily related and contributes to the understanding of the history of the Herpesvirales.},

	abstract = {Microbiome disruptions triggering disease outbreaks are increasingly threatening corals worldwide. In the Tropical Eastern Pacific, a necrotic-patch disease affecting gorgonian corals (sea fans, Pacifigorgia spp.) has been observed in recent years. However, the composition of the microbiome and its disease-related disruptions remain unknown in these gorgonian corals. Therefore, we analysed 16S rRNA gene amplicons from tissues of healthy colonies (n = 19) and from symptomatic-asymptomatic tissues of diseased colonies (n = 19) of Pacifigorgia cairnsi (Gorgoniidae: Octocorallia) in order to test for disease-related changes in the bacterial microbiome. We found that potential endosymbionts (mostly Endozoicomonas spp.) dominate the core microbiome in healthy colonies. Moreover, healthy tissues differed in community composition and functional profile from those of the symptomatic tissues but did not show differences to asymptomatic tissues of the diseased colonies. A more diverse set of bacteria was observed in symptomatic tissues, together with the decline in abundance of the potential endosymbionts from the healthy core microbiome. Furthermore, according to a comparative taxonomy-based functional profiling, these symptomatic tissues were characterized by the increase in heterotrophic, ammonia oxidizer and dehalogenating bacteria and by the depletion of nitrite and sulphate reducers. Overall, our results suggest that the bacterial microbiome associated with the disease behaves opportunistically and is likely in a state of microbial dysbiosis. We also conclude that the confinement of the disease-related consortium to symptomatic tissues may facilitate colony recovery.},

	abstract = {Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) has extended rapidly, causing alarming shrimp mortalities. Initially, the only known causative agent was Vibrio parahaemolyticus carrying a plasmid coding for the mortal toxins PirVP. Recently, it has been found that the plasmid and hence the disease, could be transferred among members of the Harveyi clade. The current study performs a genomic characterization of an isolate capable of developing AHPND in shrimp. Mortality studies and molecular and histopathological analyses showed the infection capacity of the strain. Multilocus sequence analysis placed the bacteria as a member of the Orientalis clade, well known for containing commensal and even probiotic bacteria used in the shrimp industry. Further whole genome comparative analyses, including Vibrio species from the Orientalis clade, and phylogenomic metrics (TETRA, ANI and DDH) showed that the isolate belongs to a previously unidentified species, now named Vibrio punensis sp. nov. strain BA55. Our findings show that the gene transfer capacity of Vibrio species goes beyond the clade classification, demonstrating a new pathogenic capacity to a previously known commensal clade. The presence of these genes in a different Vibrio clade may contribute to the knowledge of the Vibrio pathogenesis and has major implications for the spread of emerging diseases.},

Mounting evidence suggests that the gut virome plays a central role in maintaining homeostasis and via the GM influences immunology of the host. To thoroughly characterize the gut virome, it is often very useful to first separate and concentrate extracellular viral-like particles (eVLPs) enabling an integrative characterization of them. Here, we describe a detailed protocol for extraction and concentration of the viral fraction from fecal samples based on a polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEG) approach. These procedures maximize the yields of eVLPs (and their DNA) with high purity well suited for down-stream analysis such as quantification and morphological assessment, determination of phage-host pairs as well as virome sequencing.},

	abstract = {Sequence similarity searches are the bioinformatic cornerstone of molecular sequence analysis for all domains of life. However, large amounts of divergence between organisms, such as those seen among viruses, can significantly hamper analyses. Profile hidden Markov models (profile HMMs) are among the most successful approaches for dealing with this problem, which represent an invaluable tool for viral identification efforts. Profile HMMs are statistical models that convert information from a multiple sequence alignment into a set of probability values that reflect position-specific variation levels in all members of evolutionarily related sequences. Since profile HMMs represent a wide spectrum of variation, these models show higher sensitivity than conventional similarity methods such as BLAST for the detection of remote homologs. In recent years, there has been an effort to compile viral sequences from different viral taxonomic groups into integrated databases, such as Prokaryotic Virus Orthlogous Groups (pVOGs) and database of profile HMMs (vFam) database, which provide functional annotation, multiple sequence alignments, and profile HMMs. Since these databases rely on viral sequences collected from GenBank and RefSeq, they suffer in variable extent from uneven taxonomic sampling, with low sequence representation of many viral groups, which affects the efficacy of the models. One of the interesting applications of viral profile HMMs is the detection and sequence reconstruction of specific viral genomes from metagenomic data. In fact, several DNA assembly programs that use profile HMMs as seeds have been developed to identify and build gene-sized assemblies or viral genome sequences of unrestrained length, using conventional and progressive assembly approaches, respectively. In this review, we address these aspects and cover some up-to-date information on viral genomics that should be considered in the choice of molecular markers for viral discovery. Finally, we propose a roadmap for rational development of viral profile HMMs and discuss the main challenges associated with this task.},

	abstract = {The bacterial component of the human gut microbiota undergoes a definable program of postnatal development. Evidence is accumulating that this program is disrupted in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and that their persistent gut microbiota immaturity, which is not durably repaired with current ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) interventions, is causally related to disease pathogenesis. To further characterize gut microbial community development in healthy versus malnourished infants/children, we performed a time-series metagenomic study of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) recovered from fecal samples collected during the first 30 mo of postnatal life from eight pairs of mono- and dizygotic Malawian twins concordant for healthy growth and 12 twin pairs discordant for SAM. Both members of discordant pairs were sampled just before, during, and after treatment with a peanut-based RUTF. Using Random Forests and a dataset of 17,676 viral contigs assembled from shotgun sequencing reads of VLP DNAs, we identified viruses that distinguish different stages in the assembly of the gut microbiota in the concordant healthy twin pairs. This developmental program is impaired in both members of SAM discordant pairs and not repaired with RUTF. Phage plus members of the Anelloviridae and Circoviridae families of eukaryotic viruses discriminate discordant from concordant healthy pairs. These results disclose that apparently healthy cotwins in discordant pairs have viromes associated with, although not necessarily mediators, of SAM; as such, they provide a human model for delineating normal versus perturbed postnatal acquisition and retention of the gut microbiota’s viral component in populations at risk for malnutrition.},

	abstract = {Bacterial viruses (phages) are the most abundant biological group on Earth and are more genetically diverse than their bacterial prey/hosts. To characterize their role as agents shaping gut microbial community structure, adult germ-free mice were colonized with a consortium of 15 sequenced human bacterial symbionts, 13 of which harbored one or more predicted prophages. One member, Bacteroides cellulosilyticus WH2, was represented by a library of isogenic transposon mutants that covered 90\% of its genes. Once assembled, the community was subjected to a staged phage attack with a pool of live or heat-killed virus-like particles (VLPs) purified from the fecal microbiota of five healthy humans. Shotgun sequencing of DNA from the input pooled VLP preparation plus shotgun sequencing of gut microbiota samples and purified fecal VLPs from the gnotobiotic mice revealed a reproducible nonsimultaneous pattern of attack extending over a 25-d period that involved five phages, none described previously. This system allowed us to (i) correlate increases in specific phages present in the pooled VLPs with reductions in the representation of particular bacterial taxa, (ii) provide evidence that phage resistance occurred because of ecological or epigenetic factors, (iii) track the origin of each of the five phages among the five human donors plus the extent of their genome variation between and within recipient mice, and (iv) establish the dramatic in vivo fitness advantage that a locus within a B. cellulosilyticus prophage confers upon its host. Together, these results provide a defined community-wide view of phage–bacterial host dynamics in the gut.},

The virus has genomic features characteristic of the family Polyomaviridae but is highly divergent from other members of this family.

A real-time PCR assay was designed and used to screen 514 stool samples from children with diarrhea in St. Louis, MO; 12 specimens were positive for MWPyV. Comparison of the whole-genome sequences of the index Malawi case and one St. Louis case demonstrated that the two strains of MWPyV varied by 5.3\% at the nucleotide level.

There is no conserved phylogenetic marker. Despite these obstacles, new techniques have been developed to classify phages.The phage community in the human gut is complex but appears to be much more stable than those in other habitats, such as the ocean. Patterns of temporal and functional variation are being defined using metagenomics. Gnotobiotic animal models hold promise for further characterization of the role of phages in shaping the properties of the human gut microbiota, including its responses to various perturbations.New insights about the microbial ecology in humans have been gleaned from comparative metagenomics studies and have rekindled an interest in phage therapy. Therapeutic goals may include enhancing the ability of probiotic consortia to establish themselves, and the addition of novel functions to the gut microbiome. Representative preclinical models are needed for proof-of-principle, proof-of-efficacy, dosing and safety tests.},

	abstract = {Both linkage and linkage disequilibrium mapping provide well-defined approaches to mapping quantitative trait alleles. However, alleles of small effect are particularly difficult to refine to individual genes and causative mutations. Quantitative noncomplementation provides a means of directly testing individual genes for quantitative trait alleles in a fixed genetic background. Here, we implement a genome-wide noncomplementation screen for quantitative trait alleles that affect colony color or size by using the yeast deletion collection. As proof of principle, we find a previously known allele of CYS4 that affects colony color and a novel allele of CTT1 that affects resistance to hydrogen peroxide. To screen nearly 4700 genes in nine diverse yeast strains, we developed a high-throughput robotic plating assay to quantify colony color and size. Although we found hundreds of candidate alleles, reciprocal hemizygosity analysis of a select subset revealed that many of the candidates were false positives, in part the result of background-dependent haploinsufficiency or second-site mutations within the yeast deletion collection. Our results highlight the difficulty of identifying small-effect alleles but support the use of noncomplementation as a rapid means of identifying quantitative trait alleles of large effect.},

	abstract = {The proportion of the human gut bacterial community that is recalcitrant to culture remains poorly defined. In this report, we combine high-throughput anaerobic culturing techniques with gnotobiotic animal husbandry and metagenomics to show that the human fecal microbiota consists largely of taxa and predicted functions that are represented in its readily cultured members. When transplanted into gnotobiotic mice, complete and cultured communities exhibit similar colonization dynamics, biogeographical distribution, and responses to dietary perturbations. Moreover, gnotobiotic mice can be used to shape these personalized culture collections to enrich for taxa suited to specific diets. We also demonstrate that thousands of isolates from a single donor can be clonally archived and taxonomically mapped in multiwell format to create personalized microbiota collections. Retrieving components of a microbiota that have coexisted in single donors who have physiologic or disease phenotypes of interest and reuniting them in various combinations in gnotobiotic mice should facilitate preclinical studies designed to determine the degree to which tractable bacterial taxa are able to transmit donor traits or influence host biology.},

Phages and their encoded functions may provide informative signatures of a human microbiota and of microbial community responses to various disturbances, and may indicate whether community health or dysfunction is manifest after apparent recovery from a disease or therapeutic intervention. Here we report sequencing of the viromes (metagenomes) of virus-like particles isolated from faecal samples collected from healthy adult female monozygotic twins and their mothers at three time points over a one-year period. We compared these data sets with data sets of sequenced bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA genes and total-faecal-community DNA. Co-twins and their mothers share a significantly greater degree of similarity in their faecal bacterial communities than do unrelated individuals. In contrast, viromes are unique to individuals regardless of their degree of genetic relatedness. Despite remarkable interpersonal variations in viromes and their encoded functions, intrapersonal diversity is very low, with {\textgreater}95\% of virotypes retained over the period surveyed, and with viromes dominated by a few temperate phages that exhibit remarkable genetic stability. These results indicate that a predatory viral–microbial dynamic, manifest in a number of other characterized environmental ecosystems, is notably absent in the very distal intestine.},

	abstract = {White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV) is the most devastating viral disease affecting cultivated shrimp around the world. The CENIACUA breeding programme included host resistance as strategy to control WSSV. Since 1999, all families were subjected to WSSV challenge tests and up to 5\% of the animals survived. We suspect that a unique genetic profile could be responsible for survival. By Subtractive Suppression Hybridization improved with Mirror Orientation Selection we compared gene expression in haemocytes of WSSV-infected shrimp; seven were previously challenged (pre-challenged) and 10 naïve. Out of 1167 clones, 993 (85\%) were obtained from the WSSV-infected pre-challenged library, while 174 (15\%) were from the WSSV-infected naïve library. Differential expression was confirmed by hybridization using PCR DIG-labelled probes from unsubtracted cDNA. The 216 (18.5\%) clones differentially expressed in the WSSV-infected pre-challenged library and 23 (2\%) in the WSSV-infected naïve animals were sequenced. Relative expression of relevant gene products from both libraries was confirmed by reverse transcription real time PCR. Genes related to shrimp immune response, such as the antimicrobial peptide penaeidin, crustin, C-type lectin, protease inhibitor and chitin binding domain-containing protein were found in the library of pre-challenged shrimp. On the other hand, genes from the naïve library coded for viral structural and functional proteins. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that penaeidin-3 isoforms and crustin are over expressed in haemocytes of WSSV-infected pre-challenged P. vannamei.},

These ogt44 and ung501 mutations were not associated with multi-drug resistance and occurred simultaneously in circulating Haarlem genotype M. tuberculosis strains.

Three hundred and seventy-nine insert positive clones were selected to confirm differential expression by dot-blot hybridization. Twenty-two clones from library I and eight from library II were sequenced. All sequences from Library I corresponded to white spot syndrome virus genes. From library II, five clones were homologous with previously reported expressed sequence tags of Litopenaeus vannamei, two had similarity with β-actin and one transcript represented an unknown gene. Over-expression of VP15 in shrimp at 26°C was further confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas β-actin expression was similar in animals kept at both temperatures.
