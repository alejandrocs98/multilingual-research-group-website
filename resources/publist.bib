	abstract = {Numerous studies have suggested that a decrease in intracellular {pH} ({pHi}) is the primary stimulus for {CO}2 sensing in central {CO}2 chemoreceptors. In {CO}2 chemosensitive neurons, an increase in {CO}2 (hypercapnia) leads to a maintained reduction in {pHi} while in non-chemosensitive neurons {pHi} recovery is observed. We developed a mathematical model to evaluate the roles of intrinsic buffering capacity, Na+/H+ exchange ({NHE}), and {HCO}3−/Cl− exchange ({AE}) on {pHi} regulation in response to simulated hypercapnic acidosis. The cell model incorporates conservation of mass and electroneutrality constraints, kinetic models of the Na+/K+-{ATPase}, {AE}, {NHE}3 isoform (believed to play a primary role in {CO}2 sensing), and passive permeation pathways for ions, nonelectrolytes, and H2O. H+ buffering (both inside and out) is handled by multiple buffer species all subject to the isohydric principle. In response to simulated hypercapnia, the model predicts {pHi} responses that are consistent with observations in non-chemosensitive cells, including a {pHi} recovery mechanism that is dependent on {NHE} (based on simulation of amiloride effects). The model also demonstrates that inhibition of {NHE} is sufficient to decrease {pHi} in the absence of increased {CO}2 and that the {pHi} fall during simulated hypercapnia is exacerbated. Additional H+ extrusion pathways need to be explored to identify other mechanisms involved in {pHi} regulation in {CO}2 chemosensitive neurons. Supported by {DK}66124},

The precise mechanisms for the differential regulation of {pHi} between these cell types remain to be identified, but studies are exploring the role of Na+/H+ exchangers ({NHE}). Previously, we developed a mathematical model to investigate potential mechanisms of {pHi} regulation in response to simulated hypercapnia. We found that differences in {pHi} recovery between the two cell types could not be explained by differences between {NHE}1 and {NHE}3 isoforms. We have reformulated the model by incorporating equations describing passive electrodiffusion that adhere to the constant-field assumption (previously, we used a linear equivalent-circuit approach). Our new model confirms our previous results, and we also find that a third {NHE} isoform, {NHE}5 (also present in brainstem neurons), similarly produces {pHi} recovery in response to simulated hypercapnia. Further, in response to a simulated {NH}4+ pre-pulse protocol, {pHi} rapidly rises followed by acidification (consistent with experiments), and removal of the {NH}4+ results in further acidification, followed by {pHi} recovery that can be inhibited by amiloride. Additional H+ extrusion pathways as well as the role of the anion exchanger are being explored to identify other mechanisms involved in {pHi} regulation. Supported by {DK}66124 and {NS}045321},

	abstract = {Over the past few years, it has proven difficult to find a single marker that unequivocally identifies neurons as central respiratory chemoreceptors ({CRCs}). Previous studies in brainstem slices from neonatal rats suggested that {CRC} neurons show no {pHi} recovery during hypercapnic acidosis ({HA}) while non-chemosensitive neurons show significant {pHi} recovery under the same conditions. This lack of {pHi} recovery, however, has been demonstrated in non-chemosensitive neurons in adults, suggesting that is not a unique characteristic of {CRCs}, but rather a characteristic of neurons in brainstem respiratory regions. To identify potential mechanisms that may be responsible for this lack of {pHi} recovery during {HA}, we developed a mathematical model that allows us to investigate the role of different {pHi} regulatory mechanisms. Our previous work demonstrated that different Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms (i.e., {NHE}1, {NHE}3, {NHE}5) was not sufficient to explain this behavior during {HA}. Here, we examine a role for the {HCO}3−/Cl− exchanger ({AE}) in this {pHi} recovery response. We found that the model simulates neurons that show no {pHi} recovery during {HA} by increasing the activity of the {AE} while keeping the carbonic anhydrase activity low. This observation suggests that {AE} may be a possible cellular mechanism responsible for lack of {pHi} recovery, and therefore, it may represent a potential way to identify these neurons.

Other studies using mathematical models to investigate central {CO}2 chemoreception have focused on identifying ion channels responsible for the firing responses of putative {CO}2 chemosensitive neurons. Parameters for this kind of model are generally based on invertebrate studies, and the kinetics of acid/base transporters are often simulated by a mathematical expression that fits experimental data rather than underlying chemical kinetics. To overcome this limitation, we have coupled our mathematical model with a Hodgkin-Huxley ({HH}) type of model in order to combine the Na+ and K+ voltage-gating mechanisms with the kinetics of transmembrane transporters and passive diffusion of ions. This approach links {CO}2 signaling with neuronal firing and membrane potential responses. To evaluate the new {GHK}-{HH} coupled model, we compare its behavior to that of a simple {HH} model and its ability to generate limit cycle oscillations (e.g., trains of actions potentials).

Although the precise mechanisms for this difference in {pHi} regulation remain to be determined, it has been suggested that different isoforms of the Na+/H+-exchanger ({NHE}) may be responsible. To begin to explore this possibility, real-time {RT}-{PCR} was used to examine {mRNA} expression for three {NHE} isoforms - {NHE}1 (Slc9a1), {NHE}3 (Slc9a3), and {NHE}5 (Slc9a5) - in brainstem and cortex (non-chemosensitive control) of 21 day-old {SD} rat. Preliminary data indicate that each of the {NHE} isoforms is present in both brainstem and cortex. To further investigate the distribution within the medulla, {mRNA} expression levels for the {NHE}3 and {NHE}5 in dorsal ({dM}) versus ventral ({vM}) medulla were compared. These analyses revealed that {NHE}5 {mRNA} levels are 4-fold higher in the {vM} than in the {dM} (when normalized to Actb), but {NHE}3 {mRNA} levels are similar between the two regions. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate the relative abundance of different {NHE} {mRNAs} in chemosensitive areas such as the {NTS}/{DMV}, {VLM}, the caudal medullary raphe, and the {LC}.

We found that {HA} induced small passive changes in ionic composition that modulated membrane potential (Vm), but the firing rate changes observed were not wholly consistent to those reported in the literature, suggesting that {pH}-sensitive currents may be required. Although previous {HH}-based single-compartment neuron models have been developed to investigate {CO}2 chemoreception, these models contain only an estimate of {pH} regulatory fluxes. To overcome the limitations of the existing models, we have (1) expanded our model to include {pH}-sensitive currents proposed to participate in {CO}2 chemoreception and (2) identified the role of each current in modulation of Vm.

A distinctive feature of our model, and prerequisite for studying cellular functions in addition to the electrical response, is that fluxes are described by the permeability-based Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz ({GHK}) equation as opposed to a typical conductance-based Hodgkin-Huxley ({HH}) approach. Since experimental measurements of permeability are rare, we employ theoretical approaches to estimate parameters for each ion channel incorporated into our model. Our model behavior is then compared to that of a published comparable {HH} model. Approaches implemented include fitting simulated voltage-clamp experiments, steady-state I-V curves, and least squares analysis. Here, we isolate voltage-sensitive Na+ current and delayed-rectifier K+ current to form a minimal model for excitability and explore its dynamical features (i.e., stability, bifurcations). Implementation of this approach demonstrates that our {GHK} model yields a richer dynamical response than the {HH} model. We propose that this approach be used to generate more realistic models for studies of neuronal excitability in mammalian {CO}2 chemoreceptors. Supported by {NS}045321 and {HL}63175.},

To overcome this limitation, we recently explored firing frequency dynamics via alterations to ion channels and calcium handling mechanisms in an attempt to capture behaviors exhibited in both in neonatal and more mature (e.g., juvenile, adult) {HMs}. While we found it possible to model a variety of behaviors through such methods, certain behaviors have remained elusive.

	abstract = {The cellular factors that determine the magnitude of the firing rate response of chemosensitive neurons to increased {CO}2/H+are typically attributed to acid-induced increased firing rate pathways (accelerators). However, a marked reduction in the {CO}2/H+-induced increased firing rate during postnatal development has been observed in neurons from the locus coeruleus ({LC}). This response has been hypothesized to be due to the development of a decelerating pathway that arises from {CO}2/H+ activation of Ca2+ channels, which in turn induces the Ca2+-activation of {KCa} channels. In order to investigate the contribution of such a braking pathway in the magnitude of the firing rate in individual neurons, we have developed a preliminary computational model of excitable single neuron that simulates the voltage-gated currents as well as the {pH} and Ca2+ sensitive K+ currents using the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation. In our simulations we found that inhibition of the L-type Ca2+current led to a larger hypercapnic-induced firing rate response. These findings constitutes theoretical evidence that the cellular factors limiting the firing rate response of chemosensitive neurons are associated with acid activated Ca2+ and Ca2+ activated {KCa} currents, allowing us to conclude that a braking pathway may play a more significant role in setting neuronal chemosensitivity.

Despite control strategies that included exhaustive human dwellings' fumigations, the eradication of the disease has been unsuccessful due, in part, to vector migration. It has been suggested that contact rates between insects and people is an important factor determining the severity of the disease. Thus, understanding the relation between the insects' population distribution in houses and palms, and infestation risk factors could be important factor in designing control strategies. Here we developed an agent-based model of a hypothetical village in Colombia composed by houses and palms where insects interact based on relevant biological aspects. We used the model to weight the contribution of risk factors for house infestation (construction materials, number of people per house, number of domestic species per house, light and distance between houses and palms). We found that the model reproduced observed field studies data such as insects' densities and distribution within palms and houses. House construction materials improvement and reducing the number of people per house could be two strategies to struggle against house infestation.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of vector-borne diseases has often been linked to climate change. However the commonly complex dynamics of vector-borne diseases make it very difficult to predict risk based on vector or host distributions. The basic reproduction number (R0) integrates all factors that determine whether a pathogen can establish or not. To obtain R0 for complex vector-borne diseases one can use the next-generation matrix ({NGM}) approach. We used the {NGM} to compute R0 for Chagas disease in Colombia incorporating the effect of temperature in some of the transmission routes of Trypanosoma cruzi. We used R0 to generate a risk map of present conditions and a forecast risk map at 20 years from now based on mean annual temperature (data obtained from Worldclim). In addition we used the model to compute elasticity and sensitivity indexes on all model parameters and routes of transmission. We present this work as an approach to indicate which transmission pathways are more critical for disease transmission but acknowledge the fact that results and projections strongly depend on better knowledge of entomological parameters and transmission routes. We concluded that the highest contribution to R0 comes from transmission of the parasites from humans to vectors, which is a surprising result. In addition, parameters related to contacts between human and vectors and the efficiency of parasite transmission between them also show a prominent effect {onR}0.},

	abstract = {An epidemiological network contains all the organisms involved (types) in the transmission of a parasite. The nodes of the network represent reservoirs, hosts, and vectors, while the links between the nodes represent the strength and direction of parasite movement. Networks that contain humans are of special interest because they are of concern to public health authorities. Under these circumstances, it is possible, in principle, to identify cycles (closed paths in the network) that include humans and select the ones that carry the maximum probability of human infection. The basic reproduction number R0 in such a network gives the average number of new infections of any type after the introduction of one individual infected by any type. To obtain R0 for complex networks, one can use the next-generation matrix ({NGM}) approach. Every entry in {NGM} will average the contribution of each link that connects two types. To tease the contribution of every cycle apart, we define the virulence as the geometric mean of the {NGM} entries corresponding to the links therein. This approach allows for the quantification of specific cycles of interest while it also makes the computation of the sensitivity and elasticity of the parameters easier. In this work, we compute the virulence for the transmission dynamics of Chagas disease for a typical rural area in Colombia incorporating the effect of environmental changes on the vector population size. We concluded that the highest contribution to human infection comes from humans themselves, which is a surprising and interesting result. In addition, sensitivity analysis revealed that increasing vector population size increases the risk of human infection.},

	abstract = {Chemosensitive {LC} neurons from bullfrogs increase their firing rate and have altered action potential ({AP}) waveforms upon cooling from 20°C to 10°C (Santin et al., Amer. J. Physiol. Doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00348.2013). We developed a computational model to study this unusual neuronal response to cold temperature. Using {MatLab}, we have a 4 dimensional model based on a Hodgkin-Huxley formulation that includes a voltage-gated Na channel, a delayed-rectifying K (Kdr) channel and a leak K channel. The model generates a firing rate of 12 Hz and {AP} waveforms that are similar to those of bullfrog {LC} neurons at 20°C. For instance, values (neuron:model) for {AP} height (60 {mV}:51 {mV}), maximum rate of depolarization (36 {mV}/ms:40 {mV}/ms), maximum rate of repolarization (-27 {mV}/ms:-23 {mV}/ms), the {AP} width (2.1 ms:2.6 ms) and after hyperpolarization ({AHP}) (-60 {mV}:-66 {mV}) are similar comparing the model to the actual neuron. Colder temperature (10°C) decreases neuronal maximum rates of depolarization and repolarization, increases the {AP} width, and decreases the {AHP}. Changing, in a depolarizing direction, the voltage at which the time constant of inactivation for Kdr channels reaches a maximum and increasing the time constant for Na channel activation in the model results in similar changes in {AP} waveform parameters. However, the model changes result in decreased firing rate ( 6 Hz) while temperature changes in neurons result in increased firing rate. This suggests that another channel is involved in the temperature effects on firing rate. In line with this, we found a hyperpolarization-activated current ({IH}) in {LC} neurons that will be added in our model to determine if altering the parameters of the {IH} current contributes to cold temperature-induced increased firing rate in bullfrog {LC} neurons. We ultimately plan to use both the model and electrophysiology studies to gain insights into the neuronal basis for chemosensitivity and cold temperature responses in chemosensitive {LC} neurons from bullfrog.

To gain further insight into the anatomical distribution of the microinjection sites yielding these different discharge patterns, we implemented two multivariate classification analysis methods: Fisher Linear Discriminant ({FLD}) and probabilistic neural network ({PNN}). For {FLD} analysis, the multivariate data were transformed into univariate observations by computing the inverse of a pooled variance-covariance matrix, which was then translated back to the histological coordinates to predict physical sub-region boundaries. For {PNN} analysis, a 3-layered radial basis neural network was created with (1) the input vector for each discharge pattern yielding an output value according to how close the input vector was to each pattern weight vector, (2) the contributions for each class of inputs was summed to produce a net output vector of probabilities; and (3) a transfer function was applied to the outputs to identify the maximum probabilities and produce a classification decision. While each analysis method has its advantages (and disadvantages), both were able to predicte all of the observed phrenic discharge patterns based solely on the 3-D coordinates of the microinjection sites. We suggest, however, that {FLD} analysis may be better suited for these data. Grant Funding Source: Supported by {HL}63175},

To gain further insight into the anatomical distribution of these sites, we have used rapid prototyping technology to generate a 3-D physical model representing the relevant regions/nuclei of the cat brainstem (based on Berman’s atlas) and the histological/stereotaxic coordinates associated with our microinjection sites. To accomplish this, plates from Berman’s atlas were scanned and compiled into a 3-D configuration slide box, the stereotaxic coordinates of 348 pre-{BötC} microinjection sites were entered into an x/y/z matrix based on histologically confirmed coordinates with the origin (0, 0, 0) referenced to the caudal pole of the retrofacial nucleus, midline, and dorsal surface of the medulla, and a 3-D digital representation was generated and printed. We believe that this approach compliments both the 2-D representations (previously used) and the digital 3-D representation, and provides additional insight into the anatomical specificity of our functionally identified and histologically confirmed microinjection sites.

Using mathematical epidemiology, we provide a framework to measure and interpret how a change in the abundance and richness of species of an ecosystem could affect the prevalence and the incidence of a disease. Moreover, we are able to quantify the effect of such a change on the incidence of an infectious disease in a specific species of the ecosystem, making this framework highly relevant for assessing the impact on humans.},

Current conservation and management plans rely on the identification and preservation of corridors and potential areas for species dispersion that provide gene flow. Over the last decade, expert-based knowledge consolidation and computational modeling complemented with radio-telemetry and camera-trapping analysis defined suitable areas for jaguar long-term survival and corridors for preserving jaguar connectivity. However, none of these static models incorporate jaguar population dynamics and assume that current population distribution is at steady state equilibrium. Here, we analyze jaguar metapopulation dynamics with a spatially explicit stochastic dispersal model to predict jaguar population distribution and density at a continental level. We also incorporate other biological features in the model such as gender differences regarding movement patterns and include the effect of human-jaguar conflict. This dynamic model provides a good framework for jaguar conservation analysis by providing new insights into jaguar migration and species viability.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate the population densities and relative abundance of triatomines and mammals that may be involved in the sylvatic cycle of Chagas disease to clarify the epidemiological scenario in an endemic area in the province of Casanare. Insect vectors on Attalea butyracea palms were captured using both manual searches and bait traps. The capture of mammals was performed using Sherman and Tomahawk traps. We report an infestation index of 88.5\% in 148 palms and an index of T. cruzi natural infection of 60.2\% in 269 dissected insects and 11.9\% in 160 captured mammals. High population densities of triatomines were observed in the sylvatic environment and there was a high relative abundance of reservoirs in the area, suggesting a stable enzootic cycle. We found no evidence of insect domiciliation. Taken together, these observations suggest that eco-epidemiological factors shape the transmission dynamics of T. cruzi, creating diverse scenarios of disease transmission.},

Such a braking pathway is thought to be driven by a hyperpolarizing effect that limits the sensitivity of the cell. In a previous study we have investigated the role of both pathways in the magnitude of the firing rate response in individual neurons using a computational model of single respiratory neurons based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formulation. That model resulted in a larger hypercapnic-induced firing rate response after inhibition of the braking pathway but its behavior did not completely agree with the rhythm and pattern that characterizes chemosensitive respiratory neurons. In this study we developed a more physiologically realistic model that includes a set of {pH}- and Ca2+-sensitive K+currents and reproduces the behavior of respiratory neurons. Our simulations show that both the inhibition of acid-sensitive depolarizing currents, as well as the release from inhibition of a hyperpolarizing current, play a significant role on the increased firing rate response of the neuron to increased acidotic conditions. We consider that this model is a potentially useful adjunct for on-going research into the braking pathways involved in the chemosensitive response of neurons from different nuclei in the brainstem.},

	abstract = {Chemosensitive locus coeruleus neurons from bullfrogs increase their firing rate and reduce chemosensitive responses to {CO}2/H+ upon cooling from 20°C to 10°C (Santin et al., Amer. J. Physiol. Doi:10.1152/ajpregu.00348.2013). To study the observed neuronal response to cold temperature, we developed a computational model of temperature dependent intracellular {pH} regulation coupled with a single excitable cell model that reproduces the general behavior of a chemosensitive neuron. The model includes a bicarbonate buffering system, a Na+/H+ exchanger ({NHE}), a Na+/K+ pump, as well as Na+,Cl- and K+ leak channels. The model is also coupled with a Hodgkin-Huxley formulation that includes a voltage-gated Na+ channel and a delayed-rectifying K+ (Kdr) channel. The model responses to simulated hypercapnic acidosis are similar to those presented by Boron \& De Weer (Boron W.F., and {DeWeer}. J. Gen. Physiol., 67:91-12, 1976), producing a slight depolarization of membrane potential together with a drop in intracellular {pH}. Colder temperature (10°C) decreases the magnitude of the depolarizing response to {pH} drop in the model, and it also increases the firing rate which is observed upon cooling in locus coeruleus neurons from bullfrogs. Our simulations suggest that these responses are driven mainly by the temperature-dependence of both Na+/K+ pump and the additive effect of the leak ionic fluxes, which could explain the reduced chemosensitive responses to {CO}2/H+ upon cooling.

	abstract = {Background Leishmania is transmitted by Phlebotominae insects that maintain the enzootic cycle by circulating between sylvatic and domestic mammals; humans enter the cycles as accidental hosts due to the vector’s search for blood source. In Colombia, leishmaniasis is an endemic disease and 95\% of all cases are cutaneous ({CL}), these cases have been reported in several regions of the country where the intervention of sylvatic areas by the introduction of agriculture seem to have an impact on the rearrangement of new transmission cycles. Our study aimed to update vector species distribution in the country and to analyze the relationship between vectors’ distribution, climate, land use and {CL} prevalence. Methods A database with geographic information was assembled, and ecological niche modeling was performed to explore the potential distribution of each of the 21 species of medical importance in Colombia, using thirteen bioclimatic variables, three topographic and three principal components derived from {NDVI}. Binary models for each species were obtained and related to both land use coverage, and a {CL} prevalence map with available epidemiological data. Finally, maps of species potential distribution were summed to define potential species richness in the country. Results In total, 673 single records were obtained with Lutzomyia gomezi, Lutzomyia longipalpis, Psychodopygus panamensis, Psathyromyia shannoni and Pintomyia evansi the species with the highest number of records. Eighteen species had significant models, considering the area under the curve and the jackknife results: L. gomezi and P. panamensis had the widest potential distribution. All sand fly species except for Nyssomyia antunesi are mainly distributed in regions with rates of prevalence between 0.33 to 101.35 cases per 100,000 inhabitants and 76\% of collection data points fall into transformed ecosystems. Discussion Distribution ranges of sand flies with medical importance in Colombia correspond predominantly to disturbed areas, where the original land coverage is missing therefore increasing the domiciliation potential. We highlight the importance of the use of distribution maps as a tool for the development of strategies for prevention and control of diseases.},

Thus, control programs that include house spraying have been successful in regions were insects have a tendency to domiciliation. In the Orinoco region of Colombia, Rhodnius prolixus is the main vector presenting a stable sylvatic cycle, but is also found colonizing human dwellings. In 1997, health authorities developed a control program in the Department of Casanare spreading with insecticide houses in 667 localities. Infestation Indexes (I.I.) were calculated at the locality level before and after spraying. Times for re-infestation assessment varied between 1 and 67 months. Localities were classified into 3 groups according to their I.I. after spraying. Group 1 dropped their I.I. down to zero, Group 2 had a drop but remained positive and Group 3 increased its I.I. after spraying. We classified each group in terms of their land use characteristics before and after spraying based on satellite images obtained for the years 1997 (begining of the study) and 2002 (end of program). We found that spraying significantly reduce the I.I. on average. However, we found that time after spraying does not produce significant differences in the I.I.

The use of {TM} was associated with 12 or more minutes of {MVPA} (95 \% {CI} 4.5–19.4, p {\textless} 0.0001). Associations between meeting {PA} recommendations and use of {TM} did not differ by socioeconomic status (p value = 0.106) or sex (p value = 0.288). The use of {TM} is a promising strategy for enhancing public health efforts to reduce physical inactivity through walking for transport.

	abstract = {An increase in {CO}2/H+ is a major stimulus for increased ventilation and is sensed by central chemoreceptor neurons in various nuclei of the brainstem. Of particular importance in the study of central chemoreception are the cellular factors that determine the increased firing rate response of these neurons to acidotic conditions. A multiple factors model proposes that a set of signals and ion channel targets results in the increased firing rate response when chemoreceptors are stimulated with hypercapnic acidosis. We have developed a mathematical model for a mammalian chemoreceptor to understand the interplay between the underlying {pH}-sensitive ionic currents when stimulated with increased {CO}2/H+. It consists of an ionic membrane model of the Hodgkin-Huxley type with several {CO}2/H+-sensitive currents that makes the neuron fire at frequencies between 0.4 and 4 Hz. The currents included in the model are: fast Na+, delayed rectifier K+, inward rectifier K+, {TASK}, A-type K+, L-type Ca2+, {BK}-type Ca2+-activated K+, and a hyperpolarization activated current. We also included a background current to take account of ion flows driven by pumps and regulatory mechanisms that are not represented as independent currents in the model. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the {pH}-sensitive currents to study the effect of their conductance on the firing frequency of the neuron and to determine which currents are playing the major role in the chemosensitive response. For each current, a sensitivity factor was calculated as the rate of change of the firing frequency with regard to conductance in normocapnic conditions. The analysis revealed a higher sensitivity for {TASK}, L-type Ca2+, and background currents, with sensitivity values between −3.3 and −1.5, compared with other currents with sensitivity absolute values below 0.05. These results indicate that a small inhibition of these currents results in a significant increase in the firing rate of the neuron compared with other channels, which would result in an increased chemosensitive response with the appropriate stimulus. These findings support the multiple factors model of chemosensitive signaling and postulate {TASK} and Ca2+ currents as primary sensors. We also highlight the contribution of unknown mechanisms like acid sensitive pumps and {pH} regulatory mechanisms, which might be responsible for the unexpectedly high sensitivity of the background current in this model.},

We use an agent based model ({ABM}) to examine the effect of transport infrastructure on walking. Particular relevance is given to assess the effect of the growth of the Bus Rapid Transit ({BRT}) system in Bogotá on walking. In the {ABM} agents are assigned a home, work location, and socioeconomic status ({SES}) based on which they are assigned income for transportation. Individuals must decide between the available modes of transport (i.e., car, taxi, bus, {BRT}, and walking) as the means of reaching their destination, based on resources and needed travel time. We calibrated the model based on Bogota's 2011 mobility survey. The {ABM} results are consistent with previous empirical findings, increasing {BRT} access does indeed increase the number of minutes that individuals walk for transportation, although this effect also depends on the availability of other transport modes. The model indicates a saturation process: as more {BRT} lanes are added, the increment in minutes walking becomes smaller, and eventually the walking time decreases. Our findings on the potential contribution of the expansion of the {BRT} system to walking for transportation suggest that {ABMs} may prove helpful in designing policies to continue promoting walking.},

	abstract = {Introduction The term microbiota refers to a community of microorganisms that are located in a certain space that have a symbiotic relationship with the host cells, in this specific case the human gastrointestinal tract. This interaction provides support to the gastrointestinal tract in different functional aspects such as trophic functions, protection (immune system) and metabolism. Related to human nutrition, it has been evidenced that intestinal microbiota plays an important role in synthesis, metabolism, and other functions associated to the nutrients and micronutrients that can lead to healthy or obese patients. Objectives To understand and model the population dynamics of the intestinal microbiota using a mathematical model, and to use the model to compare lean versus obese subjects. Methods A mathematical model was design based on the gastrointestinal division in three compartments (1. Mouth to Stomach, 2. Small bowel and 3. Colon) and two major phyla of microorganisms (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes) according to its anatomical, physiological characteristics and in terms of its relative abundance of microbiota. The model included the subject's diet and activity level as inputs. Parameters for the model were obtained from a literature review. The model was implemented in Matlab and the equations were solved to steady state. Population sizes of the two microorganisms, for lean and obese subjects, were recorded. Results The model predicted a Firmicutes to Bacteriodetes ratio close to 1:1 in lean subjects for all compartments. The ratio increased to 4:1 or higher in obese subjects. These results are in agreement with several reports obtained from the literature. In addition, the model showed an interesting shift in the ratio in compartment three for obese subjects: under some circumstances increased to 7:1. The ratio is extremely sensitive to diet and exercise. Conclusion The simple mathematical model was helpful in understanding the distribution and dynamics of intestinal microbiota. The model can be used to predict the population dynamics under different diets, giving the possibility to estimate the efficacy of surgical intervention. The model can also shed some light on how to prevent the progression from overweight to obese just by changing the diet.},

	abstract = {Central chemoreceptors are highly sensitive neurons that respond to changes in {pH} and {CO}2 levels. An increase in {CO}2/H+ typically reflects a rise in the firing rate of these neurons, which stimulates an increase in ventilation. Here, we present an ionic current model that reproduces the basic electrophysiological activity of individual {CO}2/H+-sensitive neurons from the locus coeruleus ({LC}). We used this model to explore chemoreceptor discharge patterns in response to electrical and chemical stimuli. The modeled neurons showed both stimulus-evoked activity and spontaneous activity under physiological parameters. Neuronal responses to electrical and chemical stimulation showed specific firing patterns of spike frequency adaptation, postinhibitory rebound, and post-stimulation recovery. Conversely, the response to chemical stimulation alone (based on physiological {CO}2/H+ changes), in the absence of external depolarizing stimulation, showed no signs of postinhibitory rebound or post-stimulation recovery, and no depolarizing sag. A sensitivity analysis for the firing-rate response to the different stimuli revealed that the contribution of an applied stimulus current exceeded that of the chemical signals. The firing-rate response increased indefinitely with injected depolarizing current, but reached saturation with chemical stimuli. Our computational model reproduced the regular pacemaker-like spiking pattern, action potential shape, and most of the membrane properties that characterize {CO}2/H+-sensitive neurons from the locus coeruleus. This validates the model and highlights its potential as a tool for studying the cellular mechanisms underlying the altered central chemosensitivity present in a variety of disorders such as sudden infant death syndrome, depression, and anxiety. In addition, the model results suggest that small external electrical signals play a greater role in determining the chemosensitive response to changes in {CO}2/H+ than previously thought. This highlights the importance of considering electrical synaptic transmission in studies of intrinsic chemosensitivity.},

	abstract = {Leishmaniases are neglected tropical diseases exhibiting complex transmission cycles due to the number of parasite species circulating, sand fly species acting as vectors and infected mammals, including humans, which are defined in the New World as accidental hosts. However, current transmission scenarios are changing, and the disease is no longer exclusively related to forested areas but urban transmission foci occur, involving some species of domestic animals as suspected reservoirs. The aim of this study was to determine the transmission cycles in urban environments by evaluating sand fly diversity, detection of Leishmania {DNA}, and bloodmeal sources through intra and peridomestic collections. The study was carried out in Colombia, in 13 municipalities of Cordoba department, implementing a methodology that could be further used for the evaluation of vector-borne diseases in villages or towns. Our sampling design included 24 houses randomly selected in each of 15 villages distributed in 13 municipalities, which were sampled in two seasons in 2015 and 2016. Sand flies were collected using {CDC} light traps placed in intra and peridomestic habitats. In addition to the morphological identification, molecular identification through {DNA} barcodes was also performed. A total of 19,743 sand flies were collected and 13,848 of them (10,268 females and 3,580 males) were used in molecular procedures. Circulation of two known parasite species–Leishmania infantum and Leishmania panamensis was confirmed. Blood source analyses showed that sand flies fed on humans, particularly in the case of the known L. infantum vector, P. evansi; further analyses are advised to evaluate the reservoirs involved in parasite transmission. Our sampling design allowed us to evaluate potential transmission cycles on a department scale, by defining suspected vector species, parasite species present in different municipalities and feeding habits.},

Airway and environment play an important role in the etiology of these pathologies. The balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange is the pillar of the respiratory system. The aim of this project is to understand the gas exchange in the lungs using a mathematical model that describes the dynamics in each alveoli, in order to evaluate the relationship between ventilation and perfusion. Methods A mathematical model was design based on the alveoli gas exchange and its relationship between ventilation and perfusion (V/Q). So, the lungs were divided into 9 segments, each one with different ratio according to their relative exchange area and the anatomical and physiological characteristics. The model assumed mass balance for O2 and {CO}2 and ideal gas law. Parameters for the model were determined according to data obtained in the literature. The model was implemented in {MATLAB} (The {MathWorks}®, Inc.) and the equations were solved to steady state. Results The model predicted gas concentrations and flows in different lung segments. There was an evident strong association between V/Q, and its mechanisms to compensate. The model showed the behavior of lungs with and without disease. One of the most important outcomes was the evidence of enviromental influence (i.e. altitude, polution) in the imparment of the small airways and its association with the cardiovascular system. Conclusion The mathematical model was helpful to understand the gas exchange dynamics. The model can be used to predict the interaction between ventilation and perfusion under different conditions, giving the possibility to estimate the efficacy of medical intervention.

	abstract = {Introduction The term microbiota refers to a community of microorganisms that are located in a certain space that have a symbiotic relationship with the host cells, in this specific case the human gastrointestinal tract. This interaction provides support to the tract in different functional aspects such as trophic functions, protection (immune system) and metabolism. There has been evidenced that intestinal microbiota plays an important role in synthesis, metabolism, and other functions associated to the nutrients and micronutrients that can lead to healthy or obese patients. In this work we aimed to understand and model the population dynamics of the intestinal microbiota. Methods A mathematical model was design based on the gastrointestinal tract seen as a single tubular structure composed of Esophagus, Stomach, Small intestine (Duodenum, Jejunum and ileum) and colon. Only one major phylum of microorganisms (Either Firmicutes or Bacteroidetes) was included according to anatomical and physiological characteristics and in terms of its relative abundance in each part of the tract. The model included the subject's diet and activity level as inputs. Parameters for the model were obtained from a literature review. The model was implemented in Matlab and produced microorganism distribution (i.e. spatial concentration). We model different diets and pathological conditions. Results The model reveals an expected growth of either Firmicutes or Bacteriodetes associated with the amount of nutrient and carrying capacity of the gastrointestinal tract. These results are in agreement with several reports obtained from the literature. In addition, the model showed an interesting stabilization of bacterial population under some circumstances depending on the segment of the gastro intestinal tract. Bacterial population is sensitive to diet and exercise. Conclusions The model can be used to predict the population dynamics under different diets and furthermore could be implemented as an important tool for bariatric surgery patients. The model can also shed some light on how to prevent the progression from overweight to obese just by changing the diet understanding the dynamics of gastrointestinal tract population.

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is the first cause of death in the world, being heart failure responsible for most of the hospital admissions. There is a strong relationship between heart failure and chronic renal disease, where kidney disease is one of the major contributors to cardiac damage and, likewise, heart disease promotes a progression of chronic kidney disease. In this work we would like to understand the relation between systemic pressure, established by the hearth, and renal blood flow in order to determine how long it will take to irreversibly decrease renal flow below the normal perfusion rate in a person with heart failure. To achieve this, we developed a simple mathematical model that considers the cardiovascular system as a series of interconnected vessels separated by valves were bloods is pumped by the heart in a pulsatile fashion. The model predicts pressure, volumes and blood flows in 8 compartments (atriums, ventricles, arterial and venous sides for the systemic and pulmonary branches). The kidney was modeled as a parallel systemic resistance. Parameters were determined according to anatomical and physiological properties found in the literature. The system of differential equations was implemented in {MATLAB} (The {MathWorks}®, Inc.) and simulations of pathological and healthy states were set by changing the parameters. The mathematical model showed the changes of renal blood flow and filtration rate as the systemic pressure changes due to cardiovascular disease. The model indicates a short time period to preserve the renal function in patients with cardiovascular diseases, and also indicates ways to prevent the progression from heart disease to renal failure.

	abstract = {Oncolytic virotherapy is an innovative alternative to more conventional cancer therapies that is based on the ability of oncolytic viruses to specifically target and kill tumor cells. This therapy can activate the innate and adaptive immune response of the body achieving the destruction of cancer cells by the immune system. Myxoma virus is a poxvirus that infects in European rabbits, can also replicate in a variety of human cancer cells lines, which makes it an ideal candidate for oncolytic virotherapy. However, the dynamic mechanisms between the virus and the cancer cells are not completely understood. Mathematical models are useful tools to provide relevant insights about the dynamics that govern the interplay between normal and cancer cells and their viral parasites. In this study murine melanoma cancer cells were infected with a Myxoma virus expressing {GFP} ({vMyx} {GFP}) at low multiplicity of infection and pictures were taken in a fluorescence microscope every 30 minutes to determine infected cells. To understand the process of infection, namely the susceptible to infected conversion rates and the spatial effects of cell culture, we developed a mathematical model parameterized with the experiments described above that spatially explicitly simulates the process of infection. The model is an stochastic spatially explicit {SI} formulation that considers cancer cells and viral particles. With the model we were able to quantify and better understand this complex network of interactions. We were able to estimate important parameters concerning infection, proliferation and spatial dependency. We hope that the model will contribute to accelerate the development of a functional and effective oncolytic virotherapy with Myxoma virus.

The parasite is transmitted by triatomine insects, of which some species are often associated with palms. The establishment of oil palm plantations (Elaeis guineensis) in the Orinoco region (Colombia) has been rapidly growing, possibly constituting a new environment for the establishment and increase in triatomine populations. In this study, the potential of Rhodnius prolixus to colonize E. guineensis plantations and maintain T. cruzi transmission was assessed. Fieldwork was conducted in two areas located in the department of Casanare for sampling E. guineensis and Attalea butyracea palms, sampling for triatomines to determine their abundance and prevalence of T. cruzi infection. To assess T. cruzi transmission potential in the area, sylvatic and domestic mammals were sampled. Results showed that palm infestation with triatomines was higher in A. butyracea than in E. guineensis palms and T. cruzi infection in triatomines varied between habitats for one study area, but was constant in the other site. Trypanosoma cruzi–infected mammals in the E. guineensis plantations were mainly generalist rodents, suggesting that these mammals could have an important role in T. cruzi transmission in plantations. In conclusion, E. guineensis plantations in the Orinoco region are suitable habitats for R. prolixus and T. cruzi transmission.},

	abstract = {Chagas disease is a zoonosis that affects several million people and is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which is mainly transmitted through the feces of triatomine bugs. Within triatomines, several Rhodnius species have been found inhabiting palms, and certain factors such as palm species and location have been related to the abundance and T. cruzi infection of those insects in palms. In this study, the main goal was to determine if R. prolixus abundances and infection rates in Attalea butyracea and Elaeis guineensis palms are related to ecological factors such as palm species, crown microclimate, and available blood meal sources. Triatomine sampling was performed in two municipalities of Casanare, Colombia, specifically in the intersection of riparian forests and oil palm plantations. For R. prolixus abundance per palm, the predictors showing more relationship were palm species and blood meal species identified in the palm, and for T. cruzi infection per triatomine, they were palm species and nymphal stage. Palm microclimate was very similar in both palm species and did not show a relationship with triatomine abundance. Comparing palm species, A. butyracea showed more blood meal species, including more refractory host species, than E. guineensis, but lower T. cruzi infection rate and parasitaemia. Interestingly, non-arboreal blood meal species were frequently found in the analyzed nymphs, indicating that the blood source for R. prolixus in palms corresponded to all the fauna located in the surrounded landscape and not only in the palm. These results could expose a new ecological scenario to interpret the T. cruzi transmission in sylvatic environments.},

	abstract = {The Leishmaniases are a group of neglected tropical diseases caused by different species of the protozoan parasite Leishmania, transmitted to its mammalian hosts by the bites of several species of female Phlebotominae sand flies. Many factors have contributed to shifts in the disease distribution and eco epidemiological outcomes, resulting in the emergence of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis outbreaks and the incrimination of vectors in unreported regions. New research development is vital for establishing the new paradigms of the present transmission cycles, hoping to facilitate new control strategies to reduce parasite transmission. Hereafter, this work aims to model and infer the current transmission cycles of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Colombia defined by vector and mammal species distributed and interacting in the different regions and validate them by performing sand fly and mammal collections. Vector-host co-occurrences were computed considering five ecoregions of the Colombian territory defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature ({WWF}) and downloaded from The Nature Conservancy {TNC} Maps website. Four validation sites were selected based on Cutaneous Leishmaniasis prevalence reports. Sand flies and mammals captured in the field were processed, and species were defined using conventional taxonomic guidelines. Detection of infection by Leishmania was performed to identify transmission cycles in the selected areas. This study uses predictive models based on available information from international gazetteers and fieldwork to confirm sand fly and mammalian species' sustaining Leishmania transmission cycles. Our results show an uneven distribution of mammal samples in Colombia, possibly due to sampling bias, since only two departments contributed 50\% of the available samples. Bats were the vertebrates with the highest score values, suggesting substantial spatial overlap with sand flies than the rest of the vertebrates evaluated. Fieldwork allowed identifying three circulating Leishmania species, isolated from three sand fly species. In the Montane Forest ecosystem, one small marsupial, Gracilinanus marica, was found infected with Leishmania panamensis, constituting the first record of this species infected with Leishmania. In the same locality, an infected sand fly, Pintomyia pia, was found. The overall results could support the understanding of the current transmission cycles of Leishmaniasis in Colombia.},

	abstract = {Snakebite envenoming is a Neglected Tropical Disease affecting mainly deprived populations. Its burden is normally underestimated because patients prefer to seek for traditional medicine. Thus, applying strategies to optimize disease’ management and treatment delivery is difficult. We propose a framework to estimate snakebite incidence at a fine political scale based on available data, testing it in Colombia. First, we produced snakebite fine-scale risk maps based on the most medically important venomous snake species (Bothrops asper and B. atrox). We validated them with reported data in the country. Then, we proposed a generalized mixed effect model that estimates total incidence based on produced risk maps, poverty indexes, and an accessibility score that reflects the struggle to reach a medical center. Finally, we calibrated our model with national snakebite reported data from 2010 to 2019 using a Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm and estimated underreporting based on the total incidence estimation. Our results suggest that 10.3\% of total snakebite cases are not reported in Colombia and do not seek medical attention. The Orinoco and Amazonian regions (east of Colombia) share a high snakebite risk with a high underreporting. Our work highlights the importance of multidisciplinary approaches to face snakebite.},

	abstract = {Land-use change is the main force behind ecological and social change in many countries around the globe; it is primarily driven by resource needs and external economic incentives. Concomitantly, transformations of the land are the main drivers for the emergence and re-emergence of malaria. An understanding of malaria population dynamics in transforming landscapes is lacking, despite its relevance for developmental and public health policies. We develop a mathematical model that couples malaria epidemiology with the socio-economic and demographic processes that occur in a landscape undergoing land-use change. This allows us to identify different types of malaria dynamics that can arise in early stages of this transformation. In particular, we show that an increase in transmission followed by either a decline, or a further enhancement, of risk is a common outcome. This increase results from the asymmetry between the relatively fast ecological changes in transformed landscapes, and the slower pace of investment in malaria protection. These results underscore the importance of reducing ecological risk, while providing services and economic opportunities to early migrants for longer periods. Consideration of these socio-ecological processes and, more importantly, the temporal scale on which they act, is critical to avoid potential bifurcations that lead to long-lasting endemic malaria.},

	abstract = {Background The world is rapidly becoming urban with the global population living in cities projected to double by 2050. This increase in urbanization poses new challenges for the spread and control of communicable diseases such as malaria. In particular, urban environments create highly heterogeneous socio-economic and environmental conditions that can affect the transmission of vector-borne diseases dependent on human water storage and waste water management. Interestingly India, as opposed to Africa, harbors a mosquito vector, Anopheles stephensi, which thrives in the man-made environments of cities and acts as the vector for both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum, making the malaria problem a truly urban phenomenon. Here we address the role and determinants of within-city spatial heterogeneity in the incidence patterns of vivax malaria, and then draw comparisons with results for falciparum malaria. Methodology/principal findings Statistical analyses and a phenomenological transmission model are applied to an extensive spatio-temporal dataset on cases of Plasmodium vivax in the city of Ahmedabad (Gujarat, India) that spans 12 years monthly at the level of wards. A spatial pattern in malaria incidence is described that is largely stationary in time for this parasite. Malaria risk is then shown to be associated with socioeconomic indicators and environmental parameters, temperature and humidity. In a more dynamical perspective, an Inhomogeneous Markov Chain Model is used to predict vivax malaria risk. Models that account for climate factors, socioeconomic level and population size show the highest predictive skill. A comparison to the transmission dynamics of falciparum malaria reinforces the conclusion that the spatio-temporal patterns of risk are strongly driven by extrinsic factors. Conclusion/significance Climate forcing and socio-economic heterogeneity act synergistically at local scales on the population dynamics of urban malaria in this city. The stationarity of malaria risk patterns provides a basis for more targeted intervention, such as vector control, based on transmission ‘hotspots’. This is especially relevant for P. vivax, a more resilient parasite than P. falciparum, due to its ability to relapse and the operational shortcomings of delivering a “radical cure”.},

The dramatic expansion of cities around the world creates new conditions for the spread, surveillance, and control of infectious diseases.

Importantly, the interaction between environmental forcing and socioeconomic heterogeneity at local scales remains an open area in infectious disease dynamics, especially for urban landscapes of the developing world. A quantitative and conceptual framework on urban health with a focus on infectious diseases would benefit from integrating aspects of climate forcing, population density, and level of wealth.

	abstract = {A better understanding of malaria persistence in highly seasonal environments such as highlands and desert fringes requires identifying the factors behind the spatial reservoir of the pathogen in the low season. In these ‘unstable’ malaria regions, such reservoirs play a critical role by allowing persistence during the low transmission season and therefore, between seasonal outbreaks. In the highlands of East Africa, the most populated epidemic regions in Africa, temperature is expected to be intimately connected to where in space the disease is able to persist because of pronounced altitudinal gradients. Here, we explore other environmental and demographic factors that may contribute to malaria's highland reservoir. We use an extensive spatio-temporal dataset of confirmed monthly Plasmodium falciparum cases from 1995 to 2005 that finely resolves space in an Ethiopian highland. With a Bayesian approach for parameter estimation and a generalized linear mixed model that includes a spatially structured random effect, we demonstrate that population density is important to disease persistence during the low transmission season. This population effect is not accounted for in typical models for the transmission dynamics of the disease, but is consistent in part with a more complex functional form of the force of infection proposed by theory for vector-borne infections, only during the low season as we discuss. As malaria risk usually decreases in more urban environments with increased human densities, the opposite counterintuitive finding identifies novel control targets during the low transmission season in African highlands.},

Although considerable attention has focused on the long-term global cost of “losing the Amazon,” too little attention has focused on the emergence and reemergence of vector-borne diseases that directly impact the local population, with spillover effects to other neighboring areas.

It is commonly assumed that vectorial transmission is the main route for parasite spread between hosts. Recent studies have reported high percentages (21-80\%) of infected opossums (Didelphis marsupialis) in the sylvatic cycle, raising the question of whether such a high proportion of infected could be only maintained by vectorial transmission, a seemingly inefficient pathway. To address this question, we formulated a mathematical model that describes the sylvatic transmission dynamics considering vectors and hosts and parametrized with field data. Our results show that vectorial transmission it is not sufficient to explain such high percentages of infected host-mammals reported in the literature.

	abstract = {Background Snakebite envenoming is a neglected public health challenge that affects mostly economically deprived communities who inhabit tropical regions. In these regions, snakebite incidence data is not always reliable, and access to health care is scare and heterogeneous. Thus, addressing the problem of snakebite effectively requires an understanding of how spatial heterogeneity in snakebite is associated with human demographics and snakes’ distribution. Here, we use a mathematical model to address the determinants of spatial heterogeneity in snakebite and we estimate snakebite incidence in a tropical country such as Costa Rica. Methods and findings We combined a mathematical model that follows the law of mass action, where the incidence is proportional to the exposed human population and the venomous snake population, with a spatiotemporal dataset of snakebite incidence (Data from year 1990 to 2007 for 193 districts) in Costa Rica. This country harbors one of the most dangerous venomous snakes, which is the Terciopelo (Bothrops asper, Garman, 1884). We estimated B. asper distribution using a maximum entropy algorithm, and its abundance was estimated based on field data. Then, the model was adjusted to the data using a lineal regression with the reported incidence. We found a significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.66, p-value {\textless} 0.01) between our estimation and the reported incidence, suggesting the model has a good performance in estimating snakebite incidence. Conclusions Our model underscores the importance of the synergistic effect of exposed population size and snake abundance on snakebite incidence. By combining information from venomous snakes’ natural history with census data from rural populations, we were able to estimate snakebite incidence in Costa Rica. The model was able to fit the incidence data at fine administrative scale (district level), which is fundamental for the implementation and planning of management strategies oriented to reduce snakebite burden.},

We quantified the contribution of rainfall to the transmission of a diarrhoeal disease caused by the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica.

Methodology/Principal findings Here, we report the sequences of 59 {SARS}-{CoV}-2 samples from inhabitants of the Colombian Amazonas department. The viral genomes were distributed in two robust clusters within the distinct {GISAID} clades {GH} and G. Spatial-temporal analyses revealed two independent introductions of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in the region, one around April 1, 2020 associated with a local transmission, and one around April 2, 2020 associated with other South American genomes (Uruguay and Brazil). We also identified ten lineages circulating in the Amazonas department including the P.1 variant of concern ({VOC}). Conclusions/Significance This study represents the first genomic epidemiology investigation of {SARS}-{CoV}-2 in one of the territories with the highest report of indigenous communities of the country. Such findings are essential to decipher viral transmission, inform on global spread and to direct implementation of infection prevention and control measures for these vulnerable populations, especially, due to the recent circulation of one of the variants of concern (P.1) associated with major transmissibility and possible reinfections.},

	abstract = {Epidemiological models often assume that individuals do not change their behaviour or that those aspects are implicitly incorporated in parameters in the models. Typically, these assumptions are included in the contact rate between infectious and susceptible individuals. However, adaptive behaviours are expected to emerge and play an important role in the transmission dynamics across populations. Here, we propose a theoretical framework to couple transmission dynamics with behavioural dynamics due to infection awareness. We modelled the dynamics of social behaviour using a game theory framework, which is then coupled with an epidemiological model that captures the disease dynamics by assuming that individuals are aware of the actual epidemiological state to reduce their contacts. Results from the mechanistic model show that as individuals increase their awareness, the steady-state value of the final fraction of infected individuals in a susceptible-infected-susceptible ({SIS}) model decreases. We also incorporate theoretical contact networks, having the awareness parameter dependent on global or local contacts. Results show that even when individuals increase their awareness of the disease, the spatial structure itself defines the steady state.},

	abstract = {The rapid pace of urbanization makes it imperative that we better understand the influence of climate forcing on urban malaria transmission. Despite extensive study of temperature effects in vector-borne infections in general, consideration of relative humidity remains limited. With process-based dynamical models informed by almost two decades of monthly surveillance data, we address the role of relative humidity in the interannual variability of epidemic malaria in two semi-arid cities of India. We show a strong and significant effect of humidity during the pre-transmission season on malaria burden in coastal Surat and more arid inland Ahmedabad. Simulations of the climate-driven transmission model with the {MLE} (Maximum Likelihood Estimates) of the parameters retrospectively capture the observed variability of disease incidence, and also prospectively predict that of ‘out-of-fit’ cases in more recent years, with high accuracy. Our findings indicate that relative humidity is a critical factor in the spread of urban malaria and potentially other vector-borne epidemics, and that climate change and lack of hydrological planning in cities might jeopardize malaria elimination efforts.},

	abstract = {The role of climate driving zoonotic diseases’ population dynamics has typically been addressed via retrospective analyses of national aggregated incidence records. A central question in epidemiology has been whether seasonal and interannual cycles are driven by climate variation or generated by socioeconomic factors. Here, we use compartmental models to quantify the role of rainfall and temperature in the dynamics of snakebite, which is one of the primary neglected tropical diseases. We took advantage of space-time datasets of snakebite incidence, rainfall, and temperature for Colombia and combined it with stochastic compartmental models and iterated filtering methods to show the role of rainfall-driven seasonality modulating the encounter frequency with venomous snakes. Then we identified six zones with different rainfall patterns to demonstrate that the relationship between rainfall and snakebite incidence was heterogeneous in space. We show that rainfall only drives snakebite incidence in regions with marked dry seasons, where rainfall becomes the limiting resource, while temperature does not modulate snakebite incidence. In addition, the encounter frequency differs between regions, and it is higher in regions where Bothrops atrox can be found. Our results show how the heterogeneous spatial distribution of snakebite risk seasonality in the country may be related to important traits of venomous snakes’ natural history.},

	abstract = {Background: Artificial Intelligence ({AI}) and data science research are promising tools to better inform public policy and public health responses, promoting automation and affordability. During the {COVID}-19 pandemic, {AI} has been an aid to forecast outbreak spread globally. The overall aim of the study is to contribute to the ongoing public health, socioeconomic, and communication challenges caused by {COVID}-19. Protocol: {COLEV} is a five-pronged interdisciplinary mixed methods project based on {AI} and data science from an inclusive perspective of age and gender to develop, implement, and communicate useful evidence for {COVID}-19-related response and recovery in Colombia. The first objective is identification of stakeholders’ preferences, needs, and their use of {AI} and data science relative to other forms of evidence. The second objective will develop locally relevant mathematical models that will shed light on the possible impact, trajectories, geographical spread, and uncertainties of disease progression as well as risk assessment. The third objective focuses on estimating the effect of {COVID}-19 on other diseases, gender disparities and health system saturation. The fourth objective aims to analyze popular social networks to identify health-related trending interest and users that act as ‘super spreaders’ for information and misinformation. Finally, the fifth objective, aims at designing disruptive cross-media communication strategies to confront mis- and dis-information around {COVID}-19. To understand stakeholders’ perspectives, we will use semi-structured interviews and ethnographic work. Daily cases and deaths of {COVID}-19 reported from the National Surveillance System ({INS}) of Colombia will be used for quantitative analysis, and data regarding the online conversation will be obtained from Facebook and Twitter. Conclusions: {COLEV} intends to facilitate the dialogue between academia and health policymakers. The results of {COLEV} will inform on the responsible, safe and ethical use of {AI} and data science for decision-making in the context of sanitary emergencies in deeply unequal settings.},

In this work, we present Opqua, a flexible simulation framework that explicitly links epidemiology to sequence evolution and selection. We use Opqua to study determinants of evolution across fitness valleys. We confirm that competition can limit evolution in high-transmission environments and find that low transmission, host mobility, and complex pathogen life cycles facilitate reaching new adaptive peaks through population bottlenecks and decoupling of selective pressures.

	abstract = {Following the rapid dissemination of {COVID}-19 cases in Colombia in 2020, large-scale non-pharmaceutical interventions ({NPIs}) were implemented as national emergencies in most of the country’s municipalities, starting with a lockdown on March 20th, 2020. Recently, approaches that combine movement data (measured as the number of commuters between units), metapopulation models to describe disease dynamics subdividing the population into Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infected-Recovered-Diseased and statistical inference algorithms have been pointed as a practical approach to both nowcast and forecast the number of cases and deaths. We used an iterated filtering ({IF}) framework to estimate the model transmission parameters using the reported data across 281 municipalities from March to late October in locations with more than 50 reported deaths and cases in Colombia. Since the model is high dimensional (6 state variables in every municipality), inference on those parameters is highly non-trivial, so we used an Ensemble-Adjustment-Kalman-Filter ({EAKF}) to estimate time variable system states and parameters. Our results show the model’s ability to capture the characteristics of the outbreak in the country and provide estimates of the epidemiological parameters in time at the national level. Importantly, these estimates could become the base for planning future interventions as well as evaluating the impact of {NPIs} on the effective reproduction number (\$\${\textbackslash}mathscr \{R\}\_\{eff\}\$\$) and the critical epidemiological parameters, such as the contact rate or the reporting rate. However, our forecast presents some inconsistency as it overestimates the deaths for some locations as Medellín. Nevertheless, our approach demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts can provide short-term predictions of reported {COVID}-19 deaths in Colombia. Therefore, this model can be used as a forecasting tool to evaluate disease dynamics and aid policymakers in infectious outbreak management and control.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of diseases borne by mosquitoes, particularly in the genus Aedes, is rising worldwide. This has been attributed, in part, to the dramatic rates of contemporary urbanization. While Aedes-borne disease risk varies within and between cities, few investigations use urban science-based approaches to examine how city structure and function contribute to vector or pathogen introduction and maintenance. Here, we integrate theories from complex adaptive systems, landscape ecology and urban geography to develop an urban systems framework for understanding Aedes-borne diseases. The framework establishes that cities comprise hierarchically structured patches of different land uses and characteristics. Properties of the patches (that is, composition) determine localized disease risk, while configuration and connectivity drive emergent patterns of pathogen spread. Complexity is added by incorporating individual and collective human social structures, considering how feedbacks among social actors and with the landscape drive risk and transmission. We discuss how these concepts apply to case studies of Aedes-borne disease from around the world. Ultimately, the framework strengthens existing theoretical and mixed qualitative–quantitative approaches, and advances considerations of how interventions including urban planning (for example, piped water provisioning) and emerging vector control strategies (for example, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes) can be implemented to prevent and control the rising threat of Aedes-borne diseases.},

	abstract = {Background Snakebite envenoming is a neglected tropical disease affecting deprived populations, and its burden is underestimated in some regions where patients prefer using traditional medicine, case reporting systems are deficient, or health systems are inaccessible to at-risk populations. Thus, the development of strategies to optimize disease management is a major challenge. We propose a framework that can be used to estimate total snakebite incidence at a fine political scale. Methodology/Principal findings First, we generated fine-scale snakebite risk maps based on the distribution of venomous snakes in Colombia. We then used a generalized mixed-effect model that estimates total snakebite incidence based on risk maps, poverty, and travel time to the nearest medical center. Finally, we calibrated our model with snakebite data in Colombia from 2010 to 2019 using the Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo algorithm. Our results suggest that 10.19\% of total snakebite cases (532.26 yearly envenomings) are not reported and these snakebite victims do not seek medical attention, and that populations in the Orinoco and Amazonian regions are the most at-risk and show the highest percentage of underreporting. We also found that variables such as precipitation of the driest month and mean temperature of the warmest quarter influences the suitability of environments for venomous snakes rather than absolute temperature or rainfall. Conclusions/Significance Our framework permits snakebite underreporting to be estimated using data on snakebite incidence and surveillance, presence locations for the most medically significant venomous snake species, and openly available information on population size, poverty, climate, land cover, roads, and the locations of medical centers. Thus, our algorithm could be used in other countries to estimate total snakebite incidence and improve disease management strategies; however, this framework does not serve as a replacement for a surveillance system, which should be made a priority in countries facing similar public health challenges.},

	abstract = {The role of climate factors on transmission of mosquito-borne infections within urban landscapes must be considered in the context of the pronounced spatial heterogeneity of such environments. Socio-demographic and environmental variation challenge control efforts for emergent arboviruses, a major class of pathogens responsible for dengue, Zika and chikungunya, transmitted via the urban mosquito Aedes aegypti. We address at high resolution, the spatial heterogeneity of dengue transmission risk in the megacity of Delhi, India, as a function of both temperature and the carrying-capacity of the human environment for the mosquito. Based on previous results predicting maximum mosquitoes per human for different socio-economic typologies, and on remote sensing temperature data, we produce a map of the reproductive number of the disease at a resolution of 250m by 250m. We focus on dengue risk hotspots during inter-epidemic periods, places where chains of transmission can persist for longer. We assess the resulting high-resolution risk map of dengue with reported cases for three consecutive winters. We find that both temperature and vector carrying-capacity per human co-vary in space because of their respective dependence on population density. The synergistic action of these two factors results in larger variation of dengue’s reproductive number than when considered separately, with poor and dense locations experiencing the warmest conditions and becoming the most likely reservoirs off-season. The location of observed winter cases is accurately predicted for different risk threshold criteria. Results underscore the inequity of risk across a complex urban landscape, whereby individuals in dense poor neighborhoods face the compounded effect of higher temperatures and mosquito carrying capacity.Targeting chains of transmission in inter-epidemic periods at these locations should be a priority of control efforts. A better mapping is needed of the interplay between climate factors that are dominant determinants of the seasonality of vector-borne infections and the socio-economic conditions behind unequal exposure.},
