  description: Leishmaniasis, primarily cutaneous, is endemic in Colombia, where the rearrangement of transmission cycles due to human intervention in sylvatic areas impacts its spread. Analyzing vector distribution in relation to climate, land use, and prevalence, this study finds that sand flies, especially Lutzomyia gomezi and Psychodopygus panamensis, are prevalent in disturbed areas, emphasizing the need for targeted prevention strategies.

  description: Behavioral dynamics, particularly adaptive responses due to infection awareness, significantly influence disease transmission. A theoretical framework integrating game theory with epidemiological models reveals that increased awareness leads to decreased infection rates in susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) models. Additionally, the spatial structure of contact networks influences steady-state outcomes, indicating the importance of considering both behavioral and spatial factors in disease dynamics.

  description: Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Colombia's Amazonas department reveals two distinct clusters of the virus, indicating independent introductions with one associated with local transmission and another with neighboring South American genomes. This study underscores the importance of understanding viral transmission dynamics in vulnerable populations, particularly indigenous communities, and emphasizes the need for targeted infection prevention and control measures, especially in light of the emergence of the P.1 variant of concern.

  description: Snakebite envenoming, often neglected, presents challenges due to underreporting, especially in regions where traditional medicine is preferred or healthcare accessibility is limited. A novel framework integrating snake distribution, poverty levels, and medical access estimates that approximately 10.19% of snakebite cases in Colombia remain unreported annually, particularly in the Orinoco and Amazonian regions. This approach offers a valuable tool for estimating and addressing underreporting, aiding in the development of targeted management strategies, though it does not replace the need for robust surveillance systems.
